Locale fix
===================
- Make Terminal.app able to show CJK characters again by removing a setting that something added
- The setting does not exist in a newly created user account, so it should be safe to delete it

Usage
------------------
1. Run `fixlocale.bash` to apply.
2. Log off and then log on again.

Disclaimer
------------------
I take no responsibility for this script should it cause any harm.
